Hi, I'm Daniel

I've currently spent eight trying to learn how to code now but i have not still gotten anything, but i hope that with the steady steps I'm taking I hope I'll start improving.

ABOUT MYSELF
 I'm a teenager who just finished secondary school in 2018 but has not yet gained admission into tertiary institution due to some unknown circumstances. But I'm planning on studying abroad due to what Nigeria currently did to me. I'm trying to learn how to code because I want to study Computer sciences in the university and i feel i should at least have a back ground kowledge on Web development(which is actually my best course i  computer studies).
