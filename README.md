Hi, I'm Daniel

I've currently spent eight weeks trying to learn how to code now but i have not still gotten anything, but I hope that with the steady steps I'm taking I hope I'll start improving.

ABOUT MYSELF
 I'm a teenager who just finished secondary school in 2018 but has not yet gained admission into tertiary institution due to some known circumstances. I'm trying to learn how to code because I want to study Computer Sciences in the university and I feel I should at least have a background knowledge on Web development(which is actually my best aspect of computer studies).
